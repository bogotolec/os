If all pages will be accessed all times in the row, it will highly increase hit rate.
For example, sorted moodle example will increase hit amount in all cases up tp 300+ (about 30%).

Analogically, if pages requested like 
1, 2, ..., n, 1, 2, ..., n, 1, 2, ..., n etc.
then hit rate will be very low.
